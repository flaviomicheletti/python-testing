# Dependency Injection (DI): 

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that facilitates the management and 
injection of dependencies into an object or class from external sources. It 
allows you to invert the responsibility of creating or providing dependencies 
to an external entity or framework, rather than having the object itself 
create or obtain its dependencies. The main idea behind DI is to decouple the 
creation and management of dependencies from the objects that depend on them, 
making the code more modular, flexible, and testable.

The concept of a DI container is closely related to the Inversion of Control 
(IoC) principle, which is a fundamental concept in dependency injection. The 
DI container facilitates the inversion of control by taking responsibility 
for creating and managing the dependencies, allowing the objects to focus on 
their core functionalities.
