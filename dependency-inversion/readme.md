# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): 

The Dependency Inversion Principle is one of the SOLID principles and is 
closely related to DI. DIP states that high-level modules/classes should not 
depend on low-level modules/classes directly; both should depend on 
abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes). It promotes the idea that 
abstractions should define contracts, and details should depend on 
abstractions, not the other way around. 

DIP is about designing and organizing the dependencies in a way that high-
level modules/classes depend on abstract interfaces or base classes, which 
provide a level of indirection. This allows for flexibility, extensibility, 
and easy substitution of components without impacting the higher-level 
modules. In other words, DIP promotes loose coupling and promotes the use of 
interfaces or abstract classes to define dependencies, enabling DI to be 
applied effectively.
